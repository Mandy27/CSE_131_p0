# Lexical Analysis
#### CSE_131_p0
#### By Mandy Ngo, Tyler Nguyen
##### In this project, we implemented a lexical analyzer. More specifically, we implemented a scanner using Flex for the GLSL programming language.  The scanner will take the source file and transform it into the series of meaningful tokens.
##### Scanner.h and Scanner.l are the two files that we modified
##### In the rule section of scanner.l, we defined the patterns so that the scanner can recognize correctly meaningful tokens.
